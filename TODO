CLEANING:
  make a function for generating borg system calls more cleanly
  rewrite README.md

add error catching to all borg calls just in case.

Implement a resume function so that paramaters specified so far aren't lost by LockTimeout

create a gui front end to handle all of this. cross platform. web-based?
