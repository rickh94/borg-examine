allow extraction of single file instead of mounting (much safer lock-wise) and  rename recovered file and open for review
wait to close until user has confirmed file, give option to try again if it is
wrong - In Progress

CLEANING:
  clean up blocks with end of statements and comments
  make file extraction more modular - move into FoundFile?
  make a function for generating borg system calls more cleanly

Implement a resume function so that paramaters specified so far aren't lost by LockTimeout

create a gui front end to handle all of this. cross platform. web-based?

come up with a better name
