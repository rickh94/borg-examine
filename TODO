automatically umount on exit (CRUCIAL)
import config file (same file as borgmatic? borrow code?)

push to testing

interactively prune choices for backups with user input

allow extraction of single file instead of mounting (much safer lock-wise) and  rename recovered file and open for review
wait to close until user has confirmed file, give option to try again if it is
wrong

create a gui front end to handle all of this. cross platform. web-based?
